Git Commands/Tips:

Commands:

To copy a repository from gitHub use the command
     git clone {URL of repository}

To see the differences between your current working directory and the gitHub
repository from which it came
     git status

To create a change to be committed to the repository
     git add {file name w/ extension}

NOTE: 'git add .' or 'git add -A' add all changes

To commit changes to the repository
     git commit

To add a message to your commit
     git commit -m "{insert text of message here}"

NOTE: the above commands make changes to repository on local machine
To push changes to repository on github.com
     git push

To pull changes from github.com (note: must be in correct local directory)
     git pull

If you and someone else have made changes to the same lines in a file, upon
trying to pull changes, will receive a merge conflict. In the file looks
like:

<<<<<<< HEAD
{my changes}
=======
{their changes}
>>>>>>> fandsflbaerubf342rewa

to fix: 
1)manually edit file to appear how it should look, including the
correct changes.
2)git add -A
3)git commit

NOTE: if you use git commit without a message, will receive a VI file to
create a multiline message. Enter message (or leave blank), then use
command esc :wq to exit.

Now when the other person executes git pull they will receive the updated files.
